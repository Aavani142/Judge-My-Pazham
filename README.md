# [Judge-My-Pazham] üéØ


### Project Description
Judge My Pazham is a quirky and fun machine learning-powered web app that lets users upload a photo of a banana, and instantly get two verdicts:

What type of banana it is (e.g., Robusta, Njalipoovan, etc.)

How ripe it is (Green, Perfect for Pazhampori, or Overripe disaster)

Built with React, TensorFlow.js, and Vite, it combines machine learning with meme-like Malayalam humor to create a lighthearted but technically sound project.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Bananas face an identity crisis. Are they too raw? Too ripe? Robusta or Njalipoovan? No one knows, and your ammachi‚Äôs opinion is not always available on-demand.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Judge My Pazham ‚Äî a banana-judging web app that uses machine learning to tell you two things:

What type of banana you're holding

How ripe it is

All with funny Malayalam commentary, emojis, and dramatic flair. Finally, your fruit gets the attention it never needed.

Judge My Pazham ‚Äî Demo Video Description
This video showcases the "Judge My Pazham" web application ‚Äî a lighthearted and creative machine learning project that classifies bananas based on type and ripeness.

Video Walkthrough Overview:
Landing Page
The video begins with the landing page, designed with Framer Motion animations for a smooth and engaging user experience. The interface features two main actions: one to detect the type of banana, and another to judge its ripeness.

Banana Type Detection
The user uploads an image of a banana. The application uses a trained machine learning model to predict the variety of banana. In the demo, the model correctly identifies the banana as "Robusta," which is known for being thick-skinned and typically used for frying.

Ripeness Judgment
Next, the ripeness detection feature is demonstrated. After uploading a banana photo, the model evaluates whether the banana is unripe ("Pacha Pazham"), perfectly ripe ("Pazhutha Pazham" ‚Äì ideal for pazhampori), or overripe ("Chatha Pazham").
The result is displayed in a visually styled card along with a brief, humorous description tailored to the category.

Purpose of the Video
This demo illustrates how machine learning can be used in a fun and culturally specific context. It highlights the project's user interface, the banana classification functionality, and the use of modern web technologies to deliver a creative and engaging experience.
